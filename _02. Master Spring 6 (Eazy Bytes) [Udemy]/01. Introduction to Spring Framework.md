# Inversion of Control (IoC)
- IoC is a design principle where the framework, not the programmer, manages object creation and program flow.

## Dependency Injection (DI)
- DI is the method to implement IoC.
- The Spring IoC container dynamically creates and injects objects, reducing tight coupling between components. 
   
## Advantages of IoC

- **Loose coupling** between the components
    > We don't need to change or code when our dependencies change.
- Minimizes the **amount of code**
- Makes **unit testing** easy with different mocks
- Increated system **maintainability**
- Allows **concurrent or independent development**
- Replacing modules has **no side effect** on other modules

## Example

- Dependencies (`Speakers` and `Tyres`) are injected using `@Autowired`.
- The framework handles object creation and wiring, keeping the class decoupled from specific implementations.

```java
@Component
public class SpringVehicle {

    @Autowired
    private Speakers speakers;

    @Autowired
    private Tyres tyres;

    public void makeVehicle() {
        speakers.makeSound();
        tyres.rotate();
    }
}

@Component
public class Speakers {
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Speakers are playing music.");
    }
}

@Component
public class Tyres {
    public void rotate() {
        System.out.println("Tyres are rotating.");
    }
}

@SpringBootApplication
public class VehicleApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ApplicationContext context = SpringApplication.run(VehicleApp.class, args);

        SpringVehicle vehicle = context.getBean(SpringVehicle.class);
        vehicle.makeVehicle();
    }
}
```

### Key Points:
1. `@Component`: Marks classes for Spring to detect and manage as beans.  
2. `@Autowired`: Injects dependencies automatically.  
3. Spring decouples `SpringVehicle` from specific implementations of `Speakers` and `Tyres`.  

## Beans, Context, and SpEL  

### **Spring Beans**  
- A Spring Bean is a Java object managed by the Spring IoC container.  
- Beans are defined and managed using:
  - **XML configurations**  
  - **Annotations**: `@Configuration` and `@Bean`  


### **Spring IoC Container**  
- The **Spring IoC container** is responsible for managing the lifecycle and configuration of beans.  
- Key implementations:
  - **BeanFactory**: Basic container for lightweight applications.  
  - **ApplicationContext**: An advanced container with additional features (e.g., event propagation, AOP, internationalization).  

### **Spring Context (ApplicationContext)**  
- **ApplicationContext** is an IoC container for accessing Spring beans and managing the application lifecycle.  
- It provides functionality to access and manage all beans created by the Spring IoC container.

### **Spring Expression Language (SpEL)**  
- **SpEL** is a powerful expression language used to query and manipulate objects at runtime.  
- Common uses:
  - Access bean properties: `#{beanName.property}`.  
  - Perform arithmetic or logical operations: `#{1 + 2}` or `#{name == 'Spring'}`.  
  - Access environment variables or system properties: `#{systemProperties['user.name']}`.  


## Spring IoC Containers  

- The **IoC container** is responsible for:  
  - Instantiating application classes.  
  - Configuring objects.  
  - Assembling dependencies between objects.  

- **Types of IoC Containers**:  
  1. **BeanFactory**:  
      - A basic container with minimal functionality
      > Not commonly used in modern applications.

  2. **ApplicationContext**:  
      - An advanced container with additional features like event handling, AOP, and internationalization.  
      > `ApplicationContext` is a more feature-rich implementation of `BeanFactory`.
