## Software Engineering

**SDLC**: Software Development Life Cycle

**Goal**:
- Create software that is reliable, efficient, easy to use, and meets the needs of its users.
- Make the development process efficient, minimizing costs and time to market.

**Lifecycle**:
1. **Analysis and Planning**: Determine the project's scope and resources.
2. **Requirements**: Understand what the software needs to do by gathering user and system requirements.
3. **Design and Prototyping**: Plan the architecture and create a prototype to visualize how the software will look and function.
4. **Software Development**: Write the code based on the design.
5. **Testing**: Ensure the software works correctly by identifying and fixing bugs.
6. **Deployment**: Release the software for others to use.
7. **Maintenance and Updates**: Continuously update and fix the software as necessary.
