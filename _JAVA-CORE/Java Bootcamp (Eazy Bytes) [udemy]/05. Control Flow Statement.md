# Types of statements

A statement (une instruction) denotes an **operation**. There is three categories of statements:

1. **Declaration Statements**: used to introduce a new variable

  ```java
  int count = 9;
  String message;
  ```

2. **Expression Statements**: When an expression is evaluated

  ```java
  9 + 6;
  System.out,.println("Hola");
  ```

  > It includes method invocations

3. **Control Flow Statements**: Enable actions based on conditions.

# Control Flow Statements

There is four types of control flow statements:

1. **Selection** statement (condition): `if-else`, `switch-case`
2. **Iterative** statement (loop): `for`, `while`, or `do-while`
3. **Branching** statement: `break`, `continue`, or `return`
4. **Exception-Handling** statement: `throw`, or `try-catch-finally`

# `if-else` statement

- used to execute a block of code conditionally
- the condition is an expression that evaluates to a boolean

# Ternary operator

- We can use ternary operator instead of if-else statement,

  - ... when both the if and else block contain only one statement
  - ... this is because ternary operator is an expression

    ```java
    return score >= 90 ? "Grandmaster" : score >= 80 ? "Master": score >= 70 ? "Expert" : score >= 60 ? "Intermediate" : "Beginner";
    ```

# `switch-case` statement

- The expression value must be of type: `byte`, `short`, `char`, `int`, `enum`, or `String`

  > float or boolean are not accepted

- We must use a `break` in each block to exit the statement

  > `break` allow the use of the feature fall-trough allowing pltiple cases for a same block

  ```java
  switch (grade) {
      case 'A':
          System.out.println("Excellent!");
          break;
      case 'B':
      case 'C':
          System.out.println("Well done");
          break;
      // ...
      default:
          System.out.println("Invalid grade");
          break;
  }
  ```

  > 'B' and 'C' are grouped because there is no `break`

- The case label must represent a "compile-time" constant (we can not use variable)

  ```java
  case myVar: // Error
  ```

# Switch Expression (Java 14)

- Switch expression is a more concise form of the switch statement.
- It uses an arrow (`->`), and does not use a `break` statement

- we can execute multiple statement using braces (`{}`) around the block

```java
switch (fruitName) {
  case "Banana", "Apple" -> {
      System.out.println("$ 1.0 charged");
      System.out.println("Thank you!");
  }
}
```

- We can also use switch expression to **return** a value:

  ```java
  String output = switch (fruitName) {
      case "Banana", "Apple" -> "$ 1.0 charged";
      default -> "invalid";
  };
  ```

  > `default` label is mandatory when returning a value.<br>

- We can also execute multiple statement when returning a value

  - but we must use `yield` to return the value

  ```java
  String output = switch (fruitName) {
      case "Banana", "Apple" -> {
          System.out.println(fruitName);
          yield "$ 1.0 charged";
      }
      default -> "invalid";
  };
  ```

# `while` statement

- `while` statement continues to execute as long the condition is `true`

  ```java
  while (true) {
      System.out.println ("infinite loop!")
  }
  ```

  > The condition must evaluate to `false` at some point or we'll have an `infinite loop`

# `do-while` statement

- `do-while` loop executes the code block at least once

```java
do {
    // code to execute
} while (condition);
```

# `for` loop

- `for` loop execute a block of code repeatedly for a fixed number of times.
- It is used when the number of iterations is known in advance.

```java
for (initialization; condition; update) {}
```

> The **update** statement is executed at the end of each iteration, and used to update the loop variable.

```java
for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    int result = i * 5;
    System.out.println("5 * " + i + " = " + result);
}
```

- We can use multiple **initialization** statement or **update** statement separated by comma (`,`)

```java
for(int i=6, j=9; i<10 ; i++, j++ );
```

> We can not initialize variables inside update statement.<br>
> We can not initialize multiple variable of differente type:

> ```java
> for (int i=9, double j = 3.14; ;); // compilation error
> ```

- Example of infinite for loop:

  ```java
  for ( ; ; ) {
      System.out.println("Infinite loop!");
  }
  ```

  > if we leave statements empty (or with space) we get an infinite loop

# Branching statements

- allow us to jump in the flow of execution from one part of a program to another.
- used to exit from a control statement when a certain condition meet.
- There is three branching statement:

  1. `break`
  2. `continue`
  3. `return`

# `break` statement

- `break` statement is used to exit a loop prematurely based on a condition
- There is two form of break statement:

  - **Unlabelled** `break`:

    - employed to halt the execution of an inner loop
    - or to terminate a switch statement

    ```java
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
      if (i == 5) {
          break; // exit loop when i is 5
      }
      System.out.println(i); // -> 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
    }
    ```

  - Labeled `break`:

    - terminate an outer loop by specifying its label name

    ```java
    outerForLoop:
    for (int i = 1; i < 5; i++) {
        innerForLoop:
        for (int j = 1; j < 3; j++) {
            System.out.println("i = " + i + " and j = " + j);
            if (i == 3) {
                break outerForLoop;
            }
        }
    }
    ```

# `continue` statement

- There is two form of continue statement:

  - unlabeled `continue`:

    - allow to skip the current iteration and move to the next itteration.

      ```java
      for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
            continue; // skip even numbers
        }
        System.out.println(i); // -> 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
      }
      ```

  - labeled `continue`:

    - allow to skip the current itteration ...
    - and move to the nex itteration of an outer loop ...
    - by specifying its label name

    ```java
    outer:
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
      inner:
      for (int j = 0; j < 4; j++) {
          if (j == 2) {
              continue outer; // skip even numbers
          }
          System.out.println("i = " + i + ", j = " + j); // ->
      }
    }
    ```

# `return` statement

- `return` statement is used to exit a method.

# Local variables & Scope

A local variable is limited to the block in which it is declared

> - When a method is called, a new frame is created on the stack to hold local variables and parameters of that method.
> - When the method returns, its frame is removed from the stack

> Inside switch block, local variables are accessible to all the cases following its declaration.

## Best Practices

1. Declare variables with the narrowest scope possible.
2. Initialize variables when they are declared.
3. Declare one variable per line.
4. Avoid declaring unnecessary variables.
5. Keep variable declarations close to their first use.
