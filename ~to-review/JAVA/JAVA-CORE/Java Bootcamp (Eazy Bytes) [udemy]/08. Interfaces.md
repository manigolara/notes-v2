# Interfaces

Interfaces provide a way to define a **contract** that a class must follow in order to implement a certain set of behaviors.

### How to create an interface

- Interfaces can contain: static fields, abstract or default or private or static methods.
- Abstract methods don't have a body, they end by semicolon.
- Interfaces can be implemented by classes or extended by other interfaces.

```java
public interface SuperHero {
    public String usePower();
    public String stopVillain(char c);
}
```
> An interface declaration is implicitly `abstract`, the `abstract` keyword is obsolete.

> Methods are `public` by default, the public modifier can be omitted.

### How to implement an interface

The class that `implements` an interface must implement all `abstract` methods. Otherwise, the class must be declared as `abstract`.

```java
public class IronMan implements SuperHero {}
```

# Advantages of Interfaces

With the use of upcasting allows us to leverage polymorphism for code reusability and flexibility.

```java
private static void invokeSuperHero(SuperHero superHero) {
    System.out.println(superHero.usePower());
    System.out.println(superHero.stopVillain('N'));
}
```

```java
SuperHero ironMan = new IronMan();
invokeSuperHero(ironMan);
```

# Constant Field in Interface

- Interfaces can only contain fields that are **constant**.
- Fields are implicitly `public`, `static`, and `final`. They can be ommitted.

```java
public interface SuperHero {
    String UNIVERSE_NAME = "MARVEL"; // implicitly public, static, and final
}
```
> constant fields must be initialise **with a value**.

# Method Declaration in Interface

- From Java 8, we can use `static`, `default`, and `private` methods within interfaces.
- A method is `abstract` and `public` by default. We can ommit those modifiers.
    ```java
    public interface Person {
        void walk; // implicitly public, and abstract
    }
    ```

# `default` methods in interface


- `default` methods have a default implementation provided within the interface itself. 
- They allow interfaces to be extended without breaking compatibility with existing implementations.

```java
public interface SuperHero {
    default String trackLiveLocation() {
        return "USA";
    }
}
```
> default method cannot be `abstract` or `static`

# static methods in interface

From Java 8, we can write static methods inside interfaces to define any utility functionality

```java
public interface SuperHero {
    static String common Characteristics() {
        return "Superhuman abilities, Willingness to sacrifice";
    }
}
```
> We can use ***method hidding*** technique to redefine the static method implementation.

> `main()` method are allowed inside an interface.

# Multiple Inheritance using Interfaces

- We can resolve this conflict by overriding with `default` modifier

- If an interface `extends` two interfaces containing a method with the same signature, it will result in a conflict if one of them has a `default` implementation.
- We can resolve this conflict by overriding the method  providing a `default` implementation.

```java
public interface A {
    default void m1() {
        System.out.println("Default method in A");
    }
}
public interface B {
    void m1();
}
public interface C extends A, B {
    @Override
    default void m1() {
        A.super.m1();
    }
}
```

> We can invoke the parent interface's method using the `super` keyword.

# Inheriting conflicting interfaces

- The introduction of default methods enabled a class to inherit conflicting implementations from its superclass and superinterfaces.
- The method from the superclass always wins if conflicting with an interface. And the interface implementation is ignored

```java
public class A {
    public void m1(){}
}
public interface B {
    default void m1() {}
}
public class C extends A implements B {
    // m1() is inherit from A, B implementation is ignored.
}
```

# Marker Interface

- A marker interface in Java is an empty interface 
- It is used to indicate that a class possesses certain properties or should be treated in a specific way.
- For example, the `Cloneable` interface is a marker interface that indicates a class supports cloning and have overridden the `clone()` method.

```java
// java.lang
public interface Cloneable {}
```

```java
public class MyClass implements Cloneable {
    @Override
    protected Object clone() {
        return super.clone();
    }
}
```

> Marker interfaces are not as commonly used today. Annotations are more likely to be used.

# Functional Interface

- A functional interface is an interface with a **single abstract method**.
- It is used to facilitate the use of ***lambda expressions*** and ***method references***.
- It provide a **target type** for lambda expressions and is a key component of functional programming in Java.
- We use the `@FunctionalInterface` annotation to clearly indicate the intent.

```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface MyFunctionalInterface {
    void myMethod(); // Single abstract method
}
```

# Sealed interfaces
- Similar to classes, we can have sealed interfaces to restrict implementation to permitted classes.

```java
sealed interface Animal permits Dog, Cat {}
```
