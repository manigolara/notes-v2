# Structural Patterns

- **Adapter**: 
    - Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. 
    - It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces by converting the interface of a class into another interface expected by the client.

    ```java
    // Create an instance of the adapter that wraps the adaptee
    Target target = new Adapter(new Adaptee());
    
    // Call methods on the target, which are now compatible with the adaptee
    target.request();
    ```
- **Bridge**: 
    - Decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently. 
    - This pattern involves creating two separate hierarchies, one for the abstraction and one for the implementation, and linking them through a bridge.

    ```java
    // Create an instance of the implementation
    Implementation implementation = new ConcreteImplementation();
    
    // Create an instance of the abstraction using the implementation
    Abstraction abstraction = new RefinedAbstraction(implementation);
    
    // Call a method on the abstraction, which delegates to the implementation
    abstraction.operation();
    ```

- **Composite**: 
    - Allows you to compose objects into tree-like structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. 
    - This pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

    ```java
    // Create leaf nodes
    Component leaf1 = new Leaf();
    Component leaf2 = new Leaf();
    
    // Create a composite node and add leaf nodes to it
    Composite composite = new Composite();
    composite.add(leaf1);
    composite.add(leaf2);
    
    // Call a method on the composite, which will include operations on its children
    composite.operation();
    ```
- **Decorator**: 
    - Allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. 
    - This pattern provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

    ```java
    // Create a component instance
    Component component = new ConcreteComponent();
    
    // Decorate the component with additional behavior
    Component decoratedComponent = new ConcreteDecorator(component);
    
    // Call a method on the decorated component
    decoratedComponent.operation();
    ```

- **Facade**: 
    - Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. 
    - This pattern defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use. It simplifies interactions by offering a single point of entry to a set of interfaces.

    ```java
    // Create an instance of the Facade
    Facade facade = new Facade();
    
    // Use the facade to perform operations that involve multiple subsystems
    facade.performComplexOperation();
    ```

- **Flyweight**: 
    - Reduces the cost of creating and manipulating a large number of similar objects by sharing common parts of the state among them. 
    - This pattern uses a factory to manage and reuse instances of objects, minimizing memory usage and improving performance.

    ```java
    // Get a Flyweight object from the factory
    Flyweight flyweight = FlyweightFactory.getFlyweight("key");
    
    // Use the Flyweight object
    flyweight.operation();
    ```
