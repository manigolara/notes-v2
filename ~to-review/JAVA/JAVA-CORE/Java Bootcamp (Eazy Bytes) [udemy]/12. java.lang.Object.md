# Methods in `Object` class

- The Object class has **eight methods** that all classes can use.
- There methods fall into **two categories**:
  - **Final** methods: `getClass()`, `notify()`, `notifyAll()`, `wait()`
  - **Non-final** methods: `toString()`, `equals()`, `hashCode()`, `clone()
`

# `Object.getClass()` Method
- The `getClass()` method is used to determine the actual runtime class of an object.
- The `native` keyword indicates to the JVM that the implementation of the method is provided by platform-dependent native code (typically written in C or C++).
  - Native methods do not have a body, as their implementation is written in another language.

```java
// java.lang.Object
public final native Class<?> getClass();
```

```java
Fruit fruit1 = new Fruit();
Fruit fruit2 = new Fruit();

fruit1.getClass() == fruit2.getClass(); // true
```

# `Object.hashCode()` Method

-  `hashCode()` method compute an integer value associated with an object.
- It is used to provide an *index* to use for **hash-based data structures** (`HashMap`, `HashSet`, ...) 

```java
public native int hashCode();
```

> The default implementation of the `hashCode()` compute the hash code of an object by converting the memory address into an integer.

> Hash code do not garanty uniqueness.

### Rules for overriding `Object.hashCode()`

1. **Equal objects must have the same hash code**:
    - If `obj1.equals(obj2)` returns `true`, then `obj1.hashCode()` and `obj2.hashCode()` must return the same integer value.
2. **Unequal objects can have the same hash code**:
    - If `obj1.hashCode()` is equal to `obj2.hashCode()`, it does not necessarily mean that `obj1.equals(obj2)` returns `true`. This is due to possible hash collisions.
3. **Consistency of hash code**:
    - The `hashCode()` method must consistently return the same integer value when called multiple times on the same object, as long as the object's state does not change (the object fields are not modify).
4. **Overriding `hashCode()` and `equals()`**:
    - If a class overrides `equals()`, it must also override `hashCode()` to ensure correct operation in hash-based collections like `HashMap`, `HashSet`, and `Hashtable`.

```java
@Override
public int hashCode() {
    return Objects.hash(name, age, gender, ssn);
}
```

> It is recommended to utilize the **`Objects.hash()`** method for computing the hash code of an object.

# `Object.equals()` Method

- the `equals()` method is used to compare the state of two objects.
- By default, it checks if two objects refer to the exact same memory location:
  ```java
  public boolean equals(Object obj) {
    return (this == obj);
  }
  ```
- We usually override this default implementation **to compare the content** of the objects rather than their references.

> The `equals()` method is intended to compare the state (fields) of objects, not their behaviors or functionality.

### Rules for overriding `Object.equal()`

1. **Symmetry**: if `a.equals(b)` is `true`, then `b.equals(a)` should also be `true`.
2. **Reflexivity**: `a.equals(a)` should always be `true`.
3. **Transitivity**: if `a.equals(b)` is `true` and `b.equals(c)` is `true`, then `a.equals(c)` should also be `true`.
4. **Consistency**: `equals()` should return the same result as long the objects are not modified.
5. **Handling `null`**: We should handle NullPointerExceptions in the `equals()` method.
6. **`equals()` and `hashCode()` relationship**: If `a.equals(b)` is `true`, `a.hashCode()`and `b.hashCode()` must match.
    > The reverse is not necessarily true. The equality of hash codes does not ensure the equality of the objects.

### Typical overriden `Object.equal()`:

```java
@Override
public boolean equals(Object o) {
    // Check if the reference is the same, in which case they are equal.
    if (this == o) return true;
    
    // Check if the object is null or if it's not of the same class.
    if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;
    
    // Cast the object to the correct type (Person)
    // and check if all relevant fields are equal.
    Person person = (Person) o;
    return age == person.age &&
           gender == person.gender &&
           ssn == person.ssn &&
           Objects.equals(name, person.name); // We use equals() because name is a String
}
```

# `Object.toString()` method

- The primary purpose of the `toString()` method is to return a string representation of an object.
- This string should be concise and informative, expressing relevant information about the object's state.
- We commonly override this method to provide meaningful representation of the object's state.

> `toString()` is implicitly called when using `println(person)` method.

### Typical overriden `Object.toString()`:

- **Default** implementation:
  ```java
  public String toString() {
      // -> com.eazybytes.object.demo.Person@2f93fe22
      return getClass().getName() + "@" + Integer.toHexString(hashCode());
  }
  ```
- **Overriden** implementation:
  ```java
  @Override
  public String toString() {
      // -> Person{name='John', age=25, gender=M, ssn=564323456}
      return "Person{" +
              "name='" + name + '\'' +
              ", age=" + age +
              ", gender=" + gender +
              ", ssn=" + ssn +
              '}';
  }
  ```

# `String.equals()`

The `equals()` method of the `String` class is overridden to **compare the sequence of characters** of two `String` objects.

```java
String str1 = new String("John");
String str2 = new String("John");

str1.equals(str2); // -> true
```

# `Object.clone()` method

- There isn't an automatic mechanism for cloning of objects.
- Cloning involves making a copy of the object's content field by field.
- 
### Overriding `clone()`

- To enable cloning for objects, we need to manually implement the `clone()` method within our class.
- We override the `clone()` method by:
  1.  Implementing the `Cloneable` *marker* interface to notify JVM that our class is clonable.
      > A marker interface is an interface without any methods. Its purpose is to indicate to the JVM and other code that instances of the class can be cloned.
  2.  Making the overriden `clone()` method `public`.
  3.  Adding the `throws` clause to indicate it may throw a `CloneNotSupportedException`.
  4.  Calling the `super.clone()` to clone our object using the native code implementation.
      ```java
      // java.lang.Object
      protected native Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException;
      ```
      > `Object.clone()` is a native method that copies an object field by field in native code.
```java
public class Person implements Cloneable {
  @Override
  public Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
      return super.clone();
  }
}
```

`Object.clone()` returns an Object, we will need to cast in two way:
  1. By casting by the caller:
      ```java
      Person p1 = new Person("John", 25 , 'M', 234323235);
      Person p3 = (Person) p1.clone();
      ```
  2. Casting directly in the `clone()` implementation:
      ```java
          @Override
          public Person clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
              return (Person) super.clone();
          }
      ```

> Cloning via `Object.clone()` performs a shallow copy. If the object contains references to other objects, only the references are copied, not the objects themselves.

> For deep cloning, you need to manually copy the referenced objects.

# Deep `clone()`

To implement a **deep** `clone()`, we need to manually clone each field of the class that is an object.

```java
@Override
public Student clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
    Student clonedStudent = (Student)super.clone();
    clonedStudent.course =  (Course)course.clone();
    return clonedStudent;
}
```

> Note: We must implement the `clone()` method to the Course class as well

```java
Course course = new Course("Math");
Student student = new Student(course);
Student studentDeepCopy = student.clone();

student.course.subject = "French";

System.out.println(studentDeepCopy.course.subject); // Math
```
