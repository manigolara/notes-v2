## `@Lazy` Initialization

- By default, Spring eagerly instantiates Beans at startup. 
- Using `@Lazy` defers bean instantiation until it’s first needed.
> It is generally recommended to use the default eager behavior for critical beans to detect errors immediately during application startup.
```java
@Component
@Lazy
public class MyLazyBean {
    public MyLazyBean() {
        System.out.println("MyLazyBean initialized");
    }
}
```
> `"MyLazyBean initialized"` will only be printed when the Bean is first accessed, not at application startup.

## Lazy vs Eager Initialization

|                          | Lazy Initialization                      | Eager Initialization                             |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Initalization time**   | When the bean is first made use of       | At startup of the application                    |
| **Default**              | Not Default                              | Default                                          |
| **Code Snippet**         | `@Lazy` or `@Lazy(value=true)`           | Absence of `@Lazy`, or `@Lazy(value=false)`      |
| **Errors behavior**      | Errors will result in runtime exceptions | Errors will prevent application from starting up |
| **Usage**                | Rarely used                              | Very frequently used                             |
| **Memory Consumption**   | Less (until beans is initialized)        | All beans are initialized at startup             |
| **Recommended Scenario** | Beans very rarely in used in our app     | Most of our beans                                |

## Spring Bean Scopes

- By default, beans are singletons, meaning only one instance is created.
- With `@Scope(value)`, you can specify other scopes, like `prototype`, for new instances on each request.

```java
@Component
class NormalClass {}

@Component
@Scope(ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE)
class PrototypeClass {}
```

```java
System.out.println(context.getBean(NormalClass.class)); // NormalClass@5acf93bb
System.out.println(context.getBean(NormalClass.class)); // NormalClass@5acf93bb

System.out.println(context.getBean(PrototypeClass.class)); // PrototypeClass@7e7be63f
System.out.println(context.getBean(PrototypeClass.class)); // PrototypeClass@6cd28fa7
``` 

#### Prototype vs Singleton Scope

|                          | Prototype                              | Singleton                    |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Instances**            | Possibly Many per String IoC Container | One per Spring IoC Container |
| **Default**              | NOT Default                            | Default                      |
| **Code Snippet**         | `@Scope(value=SCOPE_PROTOTYPE)`        | Absence of `@Scope`          |
| **Usage**                | Rarely used                            | Very frequently used         |
| **Recommended Scenario** | Stateful beans                         | Stateless beans              |

## `@PostConstruct` and `@PreDestroy`

- `@PostConstruct` allows a method to be run as soon as the dependencies are instantiated.
- `@PreDestroy` allows a method to be run just before the bean is destroyed.
  > Useful for cleanup operations.

```java
import javax.annotation.PostConstruct;
import javax.annotation.PreDestroy;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
class SomeClass {
    private SomeDependency someDependency;

    @Autowired
    public SomeClass(SomeDependency someDependency) {
        this.someDependency = someDependency;
        System.out.println("All dependencies are ready");
    }

    @PostConstruct
    public void initialize() {
        someDependency.getReady();
    }

    @PreDestroy
    public void cleanUp() {
        someDependency.cleanUp();
    }
}
```

## Evolution of Jakarta EE

- **J2EE** - Java 2 Platform Enterprise Edition
- Then **Java EE** - Java Plateform Enterprise Edition (Rebranding)
- Then **Jakarta EE** (Oracle rebranding)

#### Important Specifications of Jakarta EE
- *Jakarta Server Pages (**JSP**)*: Used to create views in MVC applications.
- *Jakarta Standard Tag Library (**JSTL**)*: A set of tag libraries to display dynamic information in web pages.
- *Jakarta Enterprise Beans (**EJB**)*: Provides a framework for developing and managing scalable, transactional, and multi-user secure enterprise applications.
- *Jakarta RESTful Web Services (**JAX-RS**)*: Used for building RESTful web services in Java.
- *Jakarta Bean Validation*: Provides a mechanism for validating object fields.
- *Jakarta Contexts and Dependency Injection (**CDI**)*: Supports dependency injection and contextual lifecycle management.
- *Jakarta Persistence (**JPA**)*: Manages relational data in Java applications.
> Many Jakarta EE specifications have direct equivalents in the Spring ecosystem.

## XML Configuration

As an alternative to using annotations, we can specify our bean configuration in an XML file.
> XML configuration is rarely used.
```xml
<beans>
    <bean id="myClass" class="manigo.learnspring.myClass">
        <constructor-arg ref="myDependencyClass" />
    </bean>
</beans>
```

## Stereotype annotations

`@Component` - Generic annotation applicable for any class:
- Base for all Spring Stereotype annotations
- Specializations of `@Component`:
  - `@Service` - The annotated class has business logic.
  - `@Controller` - The annotated class is a Controller to handle HTTP requests.
  - `@Repository` - The annotated class interacts with the database.
> Using the generic @Component annotation wont alter the application behavihor.

#### Why should we use the most specific annotation?

- We are giving more information to the framework about our intentions.
- We can use AOP to add additional behavior.
    > Example: For `@Repository`, Spring automatically wires in *JDBC Exception* features.

## Review of Important Spring Annotations

| Annotation              | Description                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`@Configuration`**    | Indicates that a class is a source of bean definitions and configuration.                                        |
| **`@ComponentScan`**    | Specifies the packages to scan for Spring components.                                                            |
| **`@Bean`**             | Marks that a method produces a bean.                                                                             |
| **`@Component`**        | Marks a class as a Spring-managed component (bean).                                                              |
| **`@Primary`**          | Indicates that a bean should be given preference when multiple candidates are qualified for autowiring.          |
| **`@Qualifier(name)`**  | Specifies which bean to inject when there are multiple beans of the same type, by referring to the bean's name.  |
| **`@Lazy`**             | Marks a bean to be lazily initialized—only created when it is first requested, rather than eagerly at startup.   |
| **`@Scope(PROTOTYPE)`** | Specifies that a bean will have a prototype scope—Spring creates a new instance each time the bean is requested. |
| **`@PostConstruct`**    | Marks a method to be executed immediately the bean’s dependencies have been injected.                            |
| **`@PreDestroy`**       | Marks a method to be executed before the bean is destroyed, used for cleanup tasks.                              |
