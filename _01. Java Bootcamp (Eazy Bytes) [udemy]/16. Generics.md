# Generics

- Generics allows to create reusable classes and methods that can work with different data types.
- Generics let you write true **polymorphic** code that works with any data types.

# Why Generics?

- **Without Generics**: 
  - If we were **using `Object`** instead of generics:
    - We would need to keep casting when retrieving values,
      - and might get a runtime exception if not cast correctly.
    - And it would not provide compile-time type safety.

  ```java
  Storage storage = new Storage(14);
  String myString = (String) storage.getValue(); // Error: ClassCastException
  ```
  > We are getting a `ClassCastException` because we are casting an `int` to a `String`.

  ```java
  public class Storage {
      private Object value;

      public Storage(Object value) {
          this.value = value;
      }

      public Object getValue() {
          return this.value;
      }
  }
  ```
- **With Generics**:

    ```java
    GenericStorage<String> storage = new GenericStorage<>("Hello");
    String myString = storage.getValue();
    ```
    > Note: we need to inform the generic type on the left-hand side: `GenericStorage<String>`

    ```java
    class GenericStorage<T> {
        private T value;

        public GenericStorage(T value) {
            this.value = value;
        }

        public T getValue() {
            return this.value;
        }
    }
    ```

# Generics Methods

- We can also declare a generic in the method signature, instead of the class definition.
- The type parameter <T> is placed after the modifiers and before the return type.

```java
public <T> void printArray(T[] array) {
    for(T element: array) {
        System.out.println(element);
    }
}
```

# Collection without Generics
- We can create Collection objects without generics.
- When retrieving each elements we will need to cast them.
```java
ArrayList list = new ArrayList();
list.add("Hello");
list.add(123);

String greeting = (String) list.get(0);
int number = (Integer) list.get(1);
```
- With the use of Generics, we can ensure type safety and avoid runtime errors.

```java
ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
```
> Now we can only add `String` to this list, and we don't need to cast when retrieving them.

### Covariance

**Covariance** is the act of substituting a subtype with its supertype.

```java
String[] s = {"Generics", "Collections"};
Object[] o = s; // This is valid due to covariance
```
> The term ***covariance*** is used in the context of *arrays* and *generics*, while ***upcasting*** refers to *object references*.

Java decided to **not support covariance with Collections** to avoid type safety issues.

```java
List<String> s = new ArrayList<>();
List<Object> o = new ArrayList<>();
o = s; // Compilation fails as collections does not support covariance
```

- Instead, we uses ***wildcard*** types with Collections to achieve a similar effect.

```java
List<? extends Number> numbers = new ArrayList<Integer>(); // Covariant generic type
```

> By using wildcard types (`<? extends T>`), Java ensures type safety while allowing for some flexibility in the types that can be assigned to collections.



# Upper vs. Lower Bound Wildcards

### Subtype (Upper Bound) Wildcards

```java
<? extends T>
```

- A subtype wildcard means a type that is either `T` or a subtype (child) of `T`.
- **Usage Example:**

    ```java
    public static void printEmployeeNames(ArrayList<? extends Employee> employees) {
        for (Employee e: employees) {
            System.out.println(e.getName());
        }
    }
    ```
- **Key Points:**
  - **Reading Elements:** You can read elements as type `T` (or its supertypes).

    ```java
    ArrayList<? extends Employee> employees = new ArrayList<Manager>();
    Employee e = employees.get(0); // This is allowed
    ```

  - **Adding Elements:** You cannot add new elements to the collection.

    ```java
    ArrayList<? extends Employee> employees = new ArrayList<Manager>();
    employees.add(new Developer()); // Compile-time error
    ```

## Supertype (Lower Bound) Wildcards

```java
<? super T>
```
- A **supertype** wildcard means a type that is either `T` or a supertype (parent) of `T`.
- **Usage Example:**

    ```java
    ArrayList<? super Developer> employees = new ArrayList<Developer>();
    employees.add(new Developer()); // This is allowed
    employees.add(new SeniorDeveloper()); // This is also allowed because SeniorDeveloper is a subclass of Developer
    ```
- **Key Points:**
  - **Reading Elements:** You can only read elements as `Object` because the exact type is unknown.

    ```java
    Object obj = employees.get(0); // This is allowed
    Developer dev = employees.get(0); // This would cause a compile-time error
    ```

  - **Adding Elements:** You can add new elements of type `T` (or its subtypes) to the collection.

    ```java
    ArrayList<? super Developer> employees = new ArrayList<Developer>();
    employees.add(new Developer()); // This is allowed
    employees.add(new SeniorDeveloper()); // This is also allowed
    ```

### Summary

- **Subtype (Upper Bound) Wildcards (`<? extends T>`):**
  - Can read elements as `T`.
  - Cannot add new elements to the collection.

- **Supertype (Lower Bound) Wildcards (`<? super T>`):**
  - Can add new elements of type `T` (or its subtypes) to the collection.
  - Can only read elements as `Object`.

# Unbounded Wildcards

- Because covariance is not allowed with Generics, we use unbounded wildcards to achieve *implicit type casting*. `?` without any bounds (no `extends` or `super`)
- Unbounded wildcards are useful for accepting Collections holding any type.

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    List<Integer> li = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3);
    List<String> ls = Arrays.asList("One", "Two", "Three");
    printList(li); // -> 1, 2, 3
    printList(ls); // -> "One", "Two", "Three"
}

public static void printList(List<?> list) {
    for (Object obj : list) {
        System.out.println(obj);
    }
    System.out.println("List size: " + list.size());
}
```
> If we were accepting `(List<Object> list)`, we would get a compilation error because Generics do not support covariance (implicit type casting).
