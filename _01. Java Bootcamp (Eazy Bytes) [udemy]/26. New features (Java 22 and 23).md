### Launch Multi-File Source Code Programs (Java 22)

This feature allow to compile and run the main file ***even** it import code from different files*.

> This can be usefull only when we are compiling a java program manually.

```java
public class Hello {
    public static void main (String[] args) {
        Greeting.sayHello()
    }
}
```
```shell
java Hello.java
```

### Unnamed Variables & Patterns (Java 22)

We can use underscore (`_`) for variables that are unused but required because of language constraints

```java
int totalWords = 0;
for (String _ : words) { // instead of (String word : words)
    totalWords++;
}
return totalWords;
```
> This feature allow to tell our IDE and other developper this variable is meant to be unused.

### Markdown Documentation Comments (Java 23)

We can use markdown syntax for comments using 3 slash (`///`)
```java
/// this is a **markdown** syntax
/// @return this is javadoc keywords
```
