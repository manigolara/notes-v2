# Operators & Operand

Java operators fall into **two categories**:

1. Based on the **number of operands** they work with.
   1. **unary** operator: `num++`, `num--`
   2. **binary** operator: `num1 + num2`
   3. **ternary** operator: `isEven ? even: odd`
2. Based on the **type of operation** they execute on these operands.
   1. **arithmetic** operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
   2. **relational** operators (comparaison): `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `=>`, `=<`
   3. **logical** operators: `&&`, `||`, `!`
   4. **bitwise** operators: `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`

# Assignment Operator `=`

- Assignement operator `=` is classified as a binary operator.
- It is right-associative operator: It evaluate from right to left.
  > **Associativity of operators** refers to the order in which operators of the same precedence are evaluated in an expression.

# Addition Operator

Addition on numeric types are automatically casted following this rule:

1. If one operand is **double**, the other is **converted to double**
1. If one operand is **float**, the other is **converted to float**
1. If one operand is **long**, the other is **converted to long**
1. If none of the above applies, all operands are **converted to int**

```java
byte num1;
byte num2 = 5;
byte num3 = 3;
num1 = num2 + num3; // compilation error: possible lossy conversion from int to byte
```

We are getting a compilation error because the type resulting the expression `num2 + num3` is an `int` (it falls in fourth rule)

We need to specificaly cast to byte:

```java
num1 = (byte) (num2 + num3);
```

> the parenthesis used for casting is called **casting operator**

# String Concatenation Operator

1. Concatenation is evaluated left to right.
2. The `+` operator will be interpreted as a string concatenation if at least one of the operand is a string

```java
String output1 = 4 + 2 + ""; // = 6 + "" -> "6"
String output2 = "" + 4 + 2; // = "4" + 2 -> "42"
```

# Arithmetic Operators

There are two types of division:

1. Integer division: the result is truncated
2. Floating point division: the result retains its decimal precision without truncation

## Division by Zero

- dividing by 0 with 2 integers will throw an `ArithmeticException`
- but with floating-point type: it will result `infinity` or `NaN`

```java
8/0 // Throws an ArithmeticException
8/0.0 // -> infinity
0.0/0.0 // -> NaN
```

## Modulus Operator `%`

```java
21 % 2; // -> 1
-21 % 2; // -> -1
21 % -2; // -> 1
-21 % -2; // -> -1
```

> The sign of the right-hand operand is ignored

```java
6.3 % Float.POSITIVE_INFINITY // -> 6.3
```

> If the right-hand operand is infinity, the result will be same as left operand

# Unary Plus `+` & Minus `-` Operator

Unary `+` operator promote byte, short or char to an `int`;

```java
byte num1 = 9;
int num2 = +num1;
```

To avoid `int` promotion we need to explicitly cast

```java
byte num1 = 9;
byte num2 = (byte) +num1;
```

# Compound Arithmetic Assignment Operators

```java
int num = 42;
num += 3.3; // equivalent to: num = (int) (num + 3.3)
System.out.println(num); // -> 45
```

The compound operators are applicable to `String`

```java
String str = "Hello";
str += 9; // -> Hello9
```

> ... but the left operand must be a String

# Increment (`++`) and Decrement (`--`) Operator

- They are used with variable of a numeric type to increase/decrease the value by 1.
- There is 2 ways to use those operators:
  - Postfix: the value is modified after the expression is evaluated
    ```java
    int num1 = 3;
    int num2 = num1++ + 2;
    System.out.println(num1); // -> 4
    System.out.println(num2); // -> 5
    ```
  - Prefix: the value is modified before the expression is evaluated
    ```java
    int num1 = 3;
    int num2 = ++num1 + 2;
    System.out.println(num1); // -> 4
    System.out.println(num2); // -> 6
    ```

# Relational Operators (comparaison)

- Used to compare the values of its operands: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `>=` `<`, `<=`, `instanceof`
- They are used exclusively with primitive numeric data type.

  ```java
  boolean isValid1 = (true > false); // Compilation error
  boolean isValid2 = ("Hello" > "World"); // Compilation error
  ```

  > We can use equality (`==`) with boolean and reference type

# Equality Operator (`==`)

Used to assess the equality of two operands, following this rules:

1. both operands are the same type
2. For primitive operands, both operands have the same value
3. For reference operands, both operands refer to the same object in memory

> To test two strings, we should use `equal()` method instead

## Multiple Equality Expression

```java
int num1, num2, num3 = 9;
boolean a = (num1 == num2 == num3); // error: incomparable types: boolean and int
```

We need to compare each pair of operands separately because of the left to right association

```java
boolean a = (num1 == num2) && (num2 == num3); // true
```

> For floating-point types, if either operand is `NaN`, the equality returns `false`

# Logical Operators

- Logical operators take boolean operands, apply boolean logic, and generate a boolean value.
- they can only be used with boolean operands.

| ------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------- | ------ |
| `!`                       | Logical NOT                | `!false`                             | `true`                      | Unary  |

| <code>&#124;&#124;</code> | Short-circuit Logical OR   | <code>true &#124;&#124; false</code> | `true`                      | Binary |
| `^`                       | Logical XOR (Exclusive OR) | `true ^ true`                        | `false`                     | Binary |
| `&=`                      | AND assignment             | `a &= b`                             | `a = a & b`                 | Binary |
| <code>&#124;=</code>      | OR assignment              | <code>a &#124;= b</code>             | <code>a = a &#124; b</code> | Binary |
| `^=`                      | XOR assignement            | `a ^= b`                             | `a = a ^ b`                 | Binary |

> `&&` will not evaluate the second operand if the first operand is `false`. While `&` always evaluate both operands.

# Logical NOT operator (`!`)

The logical NOT operator (`!`) is a unary operator that negates the boolean value of its operand

# Logical Short-Circuit AND operator (`&&`)

- The `&&` operator returns `true` **only** if both operands are `true`
- It's referred as a *"short-circuit"* operator because, if the left-hand operand evaluates to `false`,

  - the expression **immediately** return `false` without evaluating the right-hand operand

  > The bitwise logical AND (`&`) evaluates its right-hand operand **even** if the left-hand operand evaluate to `false`

# Logical Short-Circuit OR Operator (`||`)

Returns `true` if at least one operand is `true`, otherwise, it returns `false`

# Logical XOR operator (`^`)

Returns `true` if one of the operand is `true`, but **not both**

> There is no short-circuit OR operator, because we always need to evaluate both operands

# Compound Logical Assignment Operators

There are 3 compound logical assignment operators: `&=`, `|=`, `^=`.

```java
operand1 &= operand2 // equivalent to operand1 = operand1 & operand2
```

> Java does not support `&&=` and `||=`

# Bitwise Operators

- Bitwise operators: `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`, `>>>`
- They are used to perform operations at the **bit level**.
- They can only be applied to **integer types** (`byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`) and `char`.

> To understand bitwise operations we need to convert values to bit in an intermediate step

# Ternary/Conditional operator (`?:`)

Ternary operator takes three operands:

1. a boolean expression followed by `?`
2. then an expression to be evaluated if the boolean is `true`, followed by `:`
3. finally anoter expression to be evaluated if the boolean expression is `false`

```
boolean-expression ? true-expression : false-expression
```

# Operators Precedence & Associativity

- Operator **precedence** is the order in wich Java evaluates operators in an expression.
- **Associativity** of operators refers to the order in which operators of the same precedence are evaluated in an expression.
- There is 2 types of associativity:
  - Left-associative:
    - Most of the operators are left-associative,
    - meaning they group from left to right.
  - Right-associative:
    - assignment operator (`=`)

# Precedence & Associativity Table

Table of operators precedence and associativity in order of priority:

| Precedence | Associativity | Operator                             | Operand Type                                                | Operation type                                                                                       |
