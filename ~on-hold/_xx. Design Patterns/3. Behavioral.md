# Behavioral Patterns

- **Chain of Responsibility**: 
    - Allows passing a request along a chain of handlers. 
    - Each handler can either process the request or pass it to the next handler in the chain. 
    - This pattern decouples the sender of a request from its receivers by allowing multiple objects to handle the request.

    ```java
    // Create handlers
    Handler handler1 = new ConcreteHandler1();
    Handler handler2 = new ConcreteHandler2();
    
    // Set up the chain of responsibility
    handler1.setNext(handler2);
    
    // Pass a request through the chain
    handler1.handleRequest(request);
    ```

- **Command**: 
    - Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with different requests, queuing of requests, and logging of the requests. 
    - This pattern also provides support for undoable operations.

    ```java
    // Create a command object
    Command command = new ConcreteCommand();
    
    // Create an invoker and set the command
    Invoker invoker = new Invoker();
    invoker.setCommand(command);
    
    // Execute the command
    invoker.executeCommand();
    ```

- **Interpreter**: 
    - Provides a way to evaluate sentences in a language. 
    - This pattern involves defining a grammar for the language and using an interpreter to interpret sentences according to the grammar rules.

    ```java
    // Create a context for the interpreter
    Context context = new Context();
    
    // Create and parse an expression
    Expression expression = new TerminalExpression();
    expression.interpret(context);
    
    // Evaluate the expression
    String result = context.getResult();
    ```

- **Iterator**: 
    - Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. 
    - This pattern is useful for iterating through a collection of objects.

    ```java
    // Create an aggregate object
    Aggregate aggregate = new ConcreteAggregate();
    
    // Create an iterator for the aggregate
    Iterator iterator = aggregate.createIterator();
    
    // Iterate through the aggregate using the iterator
    while (iterator.hasNext()) {
        Object item = iterator.next();
        // Process the item
    }
    ```

- **Mediator**: 
    - Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. 
    - This pattern promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, and it lets you change interactions independently.

    ```java
    // Create a mediator
    Mediator mediator = new ConcreteMediator();
    
    // Create colleagues and set the mediator for each
    Colleague colleague1 = new ConcreteColleague1(mediator);
    Colleague colleague2 = new ConcreteColleague2(mediator);
    
    // Interact through the mediator
    colleague1.sendMessage("Hello from Colleague1");
    colleague2.sendMessage("Hello from Colleague2");
    ```

- **Memento**: 
    - Allows capturing and externalizing an object's internal state without violating encapsulation, so that the object can be restored to this state later. 
    - This pattern is useful for implementing undo mechanisms.

    ```java
    // Create an originator and set its state
    Originator originator = new Originator();
    originator.setState("Initial State");
    
    // Save the state to a memento
    Memento memento = originator.createMemento();
    
    // Restore the state from the memento
    originator.restoreMemento(memento);
    
    // Retrieve the restored state
    String state = originator.getState();
    ```

- **Observer**: 
    - Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. 
    - This pattern is commonly used for implementing distributed event-handling systems.

    ```java
    // Create an observable object
    Observable observable = new ConcreteObservable();
    
    // Create observers and register them with the observable
    Observer observer1 = new ConcreteObserver();
    Observer observer2 = new ConcreteObserver();
    observable.addObserver(observer1);
    observable.addObserver(observer2);
    
    // Change the state of the observable
    observable.setState("New State");
    
    // Observers will be notified and updated
    ```

- **State**: 
    - Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. 
    - The object will appear to change its class. 
    - This pattern is useful for managing state-specific behavior in an object without needing numerous conditional statements.

    ```java
    // Create a context with an initial state
    Context context = new Context(new ConcreteStateA());
    
    // Perform operations that will trigger state changes
    context.request();
    context.changeState(new ConcreteStateB());
    context.request();
    ```
- **Strategy**: 
    - Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each algorithm, and makes them interchangeable. 
    - The strategy pattern lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it. Itâ€™s useful for choosing an algorithm at runtime.

    ```java
    // Create a context and set a strategy
    Context context = new Context(new ConcreteStrategyA());
    
    // Execute the strategy
    context.executeStrategy();
    
    // Change strategy at runtime
    context.setStrategy(new ConcreteStrategyB());
    context.executeStrategy();
    ```
- **Template Method**: 
    - Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure. 
    - This pattern helps in defining the invariant parts of an algorithm and allowing variations in the mutable parts.

    ```java
    // Create an instance of the concrete class that implements the template method
    AbstractClass abstractClass = new ConcreteClass();
    
    // Execute the template method
    abstractClass.templateMethod();
    ```

- **Visitor**: 
    - Defines a new operation to a set of objects without changing the objects themselves. 
    - This pattern allows you to add further operations to objects without having to modify them. 
    - It is useful for separating operations from the objects on which they operate.

    ```java
    // Create concrete elements
    Element element1 = new ConcreteElement1();
    Element element2 = new ConcreteElement2();
    
    // Create a visitor
    Visitor visitor = new ConcreteVisitor();
    
    // Accept the visitor for each element
    element1.accept(visitor);
    element2.accept(visitor);
    ```
