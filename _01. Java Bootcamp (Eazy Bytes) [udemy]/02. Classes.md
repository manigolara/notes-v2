# Method Signature

The signature of a method is composed of 4 elements:

- Name of the method
- Types of parameters
- Number of parameters
- Order of parameters

> Modifiers and return types are not part of the signature of a method.

| Method Declaration                          | Method Signature   |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `public int add (int num1, int num2)`       | `add(int, int)`    |
| `public double add (int num1, double num2)` | `add(int, double)` |
| `public double add (double num1, int num2)` | `add(double, int)` |

# Constructor

- invoked when we instanciate an object
- serves to initialize object's state by assiging values

> We don't specify any return type, not even `void`

## Constructor Chaining

We can invoke other constructors inside a constructor with `this()` keyword

```java
public Employee () {
    this("John", "Deo");
}
public Employee (String firstName, String lastName) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
}
```

> The call to another constructor must be the first statement inside the constructor

# Instance Initialization

- ...is executed when an object is instantiated

```java
public class Car {
    String model;

    {
        this.model = "Camry";
    }
}
```

> Why instance Initialization instead of constructor initialization?
>
> - 1. Usefull for anonymous classes which don't have constructors
> - 2. Allow to write logic shared with all constructors

# Static Variables

- A static variable is a variable that belongs to a class rather than an instance
- Typically used to store data that is common to all instances
  > They are stored in the memory area known as the "Class Area".
  > This area is shared by all threads.

# Constant Variables

- To make a variable constant we must use `static` and `final` keyword

# Static Methods

- Static methods belongs to a class rather than an instance.
- Use cases:

  - Commonly used for Utility functions.
  - Used for factory methods that create new instances of a class.
  - Used to perform global operations that affects all instances of the class.

- Static methods can not access instance variables or instance methods.

> Both static and non-static methods are store in the "method area".<br>
> Only the object and instance variables are stored in the heap.

# Static Initialization Block

- The Static Initialization Block (SIB) is a block of code that is associated with a class rather than with instances of that class.
- the SIB is executed when the class is loaded into the JVM for the first time.
- The primary purpose of the SIB is to initialize static variables of a class.

```java
public class Car {
  static byte noOfEngines;

  static {
    noOfEngines = 1;
  }
}
```

> A SIB is useful when we need to perform complex initialization logic that cannot be accommodated wihin a single line.

> SIB are executed once and before the main() method.

| Static Initializer Block                                                                        | Instance initializer block                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Starts with the keyword `static` followed by `{}`                                               | Starts with `{}`                                                                                            |
| Executes during class loading                                                                   | Executes during object instantiation                                                                        |
| It can only refer static variables                                                              | It can refer both static & non-static variables                                                             |
| It can not use `this` keyword                                                                   | It can use `this` keyword                                                                                   |
| It executes only once during the life time of the program, when the class loads into the memory | It runs everytime there is a call to the constructor or when we try to create a object using `new` operator |

# Where does Java store everything

- **Heap** memory: Area of memory where objects are allocated.
- **Stack** memory: Area of memory where local variables and method calls are stored.
- **Method Area**: Area of memory where class definitions, method definitions, and other runtime constants are stored.
- **Native Heap**: Area of memory where native libraries and code are loaded.

> The garbage collector desallocates memory from the Heap for objects tha are not longer being used.

# Encapsulation

In OOP, encapsulation refers to two concepts:

1. Grouping attributes(fields) and behaviors(methods) together within a single objects
2. It involve the practice of hiding certain fields and methods from public access using access modifiers (private, protected, etc...)
