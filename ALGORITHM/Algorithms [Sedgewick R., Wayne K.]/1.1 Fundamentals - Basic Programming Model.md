# Basic Programming Model

## Basic structure of a Java program

A Java program (class) is either a:

- library of **static methods** (functions)
- or a **data type** definition

To create those, we use the following **five components**:

- ### Primitive data types (_Type de données primitif_)
  - **define** the meaning of terms like _integer_, _real number_, and _boolean_
  - Their **definition** includes the set of **possible values** and **operations** on those values
  - An **expression** is the combination of those operation
- ### Statements (_Instructions_)
  - allow us to define a **computation** by:
    - creating and assigning **values** to variables,
    - controlling **execution** flow,
    - or causing **side effects**
  - We use **six types** of statements:
    - **declarations**,
    - **assignments**,
    - **conditionals**,
    - **loops**,
    - **calls**,
    - and **returns**
- ### Arrays (_Tableaux_)
  - allow us to work with **multiple values** of the same type
- ### Static methods (_Méthodes statiques_)
  - allow us to **encapsulate and reuse code** ...
  - and to develop programs as a set of independent modules.
- ### Strings (_Chaînes de caractères_)
  - are **sequences** of characters. Some operations on them are built in to Java.
- ### Input/output (_Entrée/sortie_)
  - sets up **communication** between programs and the outside world.
- ### Data abstraction (_Abstraction de données_)
  - extends encapsulation and reuse to allow us to **define non-primitive** data types,
  - thus supporting **object-oriented programming**

## Primitive data types and expressions

A data type is a **set of values** and a **set of operations** on those values

- We begin by considering the following **four primitive data types**:
  - **Integers**, with arithmetic operations (`int`)
  - **Real numbers**, again with arithmetic operations (`double`)
  - **Booleans**, the set of values { true, false } with logical operations (`boolean`)
  - **Characters**, the alphanumeric characters and symbols that you type (`char)`
- Next we consider **mechanisms** for specifying values and operations for these types:
  - A Java program manipulates variables that are named with **identifiers**
  - Each **variable** is associated with a **data type** and stores one of the permissible data-type **values**

## Basic building blocks for Java programs

- ### primitive data type:
  - a set of values and a set of operations on those values
  - ex: `int`, `double`, `boolean`, `char`
- ### identifier
  - a sequence of letters, digits, \_, and $
  - ex: `a`, `abc`, `Ab$`, `a_b`, `ab123`, `lo`, `hi`
- ### variable
  - names a data-type **value**
  - ex: _any identifier_
- ### operator
  - names a data-type **operation**
  - ex: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- ### literal
  - source-code **representation** of a value
  - ex: `-42`, `3.14`, `1.0e-15`, `true`, `'a' '+' '9'`
- ### expression
  - sequence of operations on literals and/or variables that **produces a value**
  - ex: lo + `(hi - lo)/2`, `lo <= hi`

## Statements (Instructions)

- Define the **computation** by:
  - creating and manipulating **variables**,
  - assigning data-type **values** to them,
  - and controlling the flow of **execution** of such operations.
- Statements are often organized in **blocks** within curly braces.
  - ### Déclarations
    - create variables of a specified type and name them with identifiers.
    - Java associates a variable name with a type at compile time
  - ### Assignments
    - associate a data-type value (defined by an expression) with a variable.
  - ### Conditionals
    - provide for a simple change in the flow of execution
    - execute the statements in one of two blocks, depending on a specified condition
  - ### Loops
    - provide for a more profound change in the flow of execution
    - execute the statements in a block as long as a given condition is true
  - ### Calls and returns (break and continue)
    - provide another way to change the flow of execution and to organize code
      > We rarely use `break` and `continue` these statements in the code

A program is a **sequence** of statements,
with _declarations_, _assignments_, _conditionals_, _loops_, _calls_, and _returns_.

## Arrays (Tableau)

An array stores a sequence of values that are all of the same type

### Creating and initializing an array

Making an array in a Java program involves three distinct steps:

1. #### Declare the array name and type

   - you need to specify a name and the type of data it will contain

2. #### Create the array

   - you need to specify its length (the number of values)
   - The Array object allocates memory at runtime with a fixed size

   > The size cannot be changed after creation

3. #### Initilize the array values

   > we typically use a loop to iterate each element to set each valuea

```java
// long form
double[] a;
a = new double[N];
// short form
double[] b = new double[N]
// initializing declaration
int[] a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

### Using an array

- Once we create an array, its size is fixed
- The last element of an array `a[]` is always '`a[a.length-1]`'
  > Java use automatic bounds checking to prevents accessing elements outside the range.
  > If so, it throw `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` runtime exception

### Aliasing

- An array name refers to the whole array
- If we assign one array name to another, then both refer to the same array

```java
int[] b = a;
b[i] = 123; // a[i] is now 123.
```

This situation is known as **aliasing** and can lead to subtle bugs

> If your intent is to make a copy of an array, you need to copy all the entries to a new array

#### Two-dimensional arrays

```java
double[][] a = new double[M][N];
```

- We refer to such an array as an **M-by-N** array
  > By convention, the first dimension is the number of rows and the second is the number of columns
- Java initializes all entries in arrays of numeric types to zero ...
- and in arrays of boolean values to false

#### Typical array-processing code

- ##### find the maximum of the array values
  ```java
  double max = a[0];
  for (int i = 1; i < a.length; i++)
    if (a[i] > max) max = a[i];
  ```
- ##### compute the average of the array values

  ```java
  int N = a.length;
  double sum = 0.0;
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    sum += a[i];
  double average = sum / N;
  ```

- ##### copy to another array

  ```java
  int N = a.length;
  double[] b = new double[N];
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    b[i] = a[i];
  ```

- ##### reverse the elements within an array

  ```java
  int N = a.length;
  for (int i = 0; i < N/2; i++)
  {
    double temp = a[i];
    a[i] = a[N-1-i];
    a[N-i-1] = temp;
  }
  ```

- ##### matrix-matrix multiplication (square matrices): `a[][]*b[][] = c[][]`

  ```java
  int N = a.length;
  double[][] c = new double[N][N];
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    for (int j = 0; j < N; j++)
      { // Compute dot product of row i and column j.
        for (int k = 0; k < N; k++)
          c[i][j] += a[i][k]*b[k][j];
      }
  ```

## Static methods

- Static methods are called **functions** in many programming languages
- Each static method is a **sequence of statements** that are executed

### Defining a static method

- A method encapsulates a computation that is defined as a sequence of statements
- A method takes arguments (values of given data types)
  - and computes a return value of some data type that depends upon the arguments
  - or causes a side effect that depends on the arguments (such as printing a value)

### Invoking a static method

- When the method call is part of an expression,
  - the method computes a value,
  - and that value is used in place of the call in the expression.
- When the method is called followed by a semicolon `;`
  - the method is a statement that generally causes side effects.
- When a method is called,
  - its argument variables are initialized,
  - with the values of the corresponding expressions in the call.
- A return statement terminates a static method, returning control to the caller.

### Properties of methods

- #### Arguments are passed by value
  - The only difference between an argument variable and a local variable is that:
    - the argument variable is initialized with the argument value provided by the calling code.
  - The method works with the value of its arguments, not the arguments themselves,
    - changing the value of an argument variable within a static method has no effect on the calling code.
- #### Method names can be overloaded
  - A common use of overloading is to define two different versions of a function,
  - one that takes an argument and another that uses a default value of that argument.
- #### A method has a single return value but may have multiple return statements:
  - A Java method can provide only one return value, of the type declared in the
    method signature.
  - Control goes back to the calling program as soon as the first return statement in a static method is reached.
- #### A method can have side effects
  - A method may use the keyword void as its return type, to indicate that it has no return value
  - A void static method is said to produce side effects
    > _consume input, produce output, change entries in an array,<br>
    > or otherwise change the state of the system_

### Recursion

- The recursion has a **base case**
  - we always include a conditional statement as the first statement in the program that has a return.
- Recursive calls must address subproblems that are **smaller** in some sense,
  - so that recursive calls converge to the base case.
