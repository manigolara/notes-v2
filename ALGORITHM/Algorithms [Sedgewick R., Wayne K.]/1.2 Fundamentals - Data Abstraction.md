# Basic Programming Model

- A data type is a set of **values** and a set of **operations** on those values.
- An **abstract data type** (ADT) is a data type whose representation is **hidden** from the client.
- **Using** an ADT vs **Implementing** an ADT:

  - **When using** an ADT:

    - we focus on the **operations** specified in the API,
    - and pay no attention to the data representation

  - **When implementing** an ADT:
    - we focus on the **data**,
    - then implement operations on that data

- **Application programming interface** (API):

  - Used to specify the **behavior** of an abstract data type

> 1. We **implement data types** in independent Java class modules
> 2. We **write client programs that use** them.

- Objects are characterized by three essential properties: state, identity, and
  behavior:
  - **State**: Refers to the **data** that the object holds at any given moment
  - **Identity**: Is a unique identifier that distinguishes it from other objects
  - **Behavior**: Refers to the **operations** that the object can perform

## Implementing an abstract data type

### Instance variables

- We declare **instance variables** to define **data-type values** (the state of each object)

### Constructors

- Every Java class has at least one constructor that establishes an **object’s identity**
- Generally, the purpose of a constructor is to **initialize the instance variables**
- Every constructor creates an object and provides to the client a **reference to that object**
- If no constructor is defined, an **_implicit default no-arguments constructor_** initializes instance values to default values:
  - `0` for **primitive numeric types**
  - `false` for **boolean**
  - and `null` for **reference types**

### Instance methods

- We implement instance methods to define the **behavior** of each object
- When a client invokes a method, the parameter values (if any) are **initialized with client values**

### Scope

Instance methods uses three kinds of variables:

- #### Parameter variables:
  - Their scope is the entire method
- #### Local variables:
  - Their scope is the following statements in the block where they are defined
- #### Instance variables:
  - Their scope is the entire class

## Data-type design

An **abstract data type** is a data type whose representation is **hidden** from the client.

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation enables **modular** programming, allowing us to:

- **Independently** develop of client and implementation code
- **Substitute** improved implementations without affecting clients
- **Support** programs not yet written (the API is a guide for any future client)

Encapsulation also **isolates** data-type operations:

- **Limiting** the potential for **error**
- Adding **consistency** checks and other debugging tools in implementations
- Clarifying **client code**

> The key to success in modular programming is to maintain independence among modules
> We do so by insisting on the API being the only point of dependence between client and implementation

### Designing APIs

One of the most important steps in building modern software is designing APIs

> Provide to clients the methods they need and no others

### Algorithms and abstract data types

Data abstraction allow us to specify both:

- **what** an algorithm needs to accomplish
- and **how** a client can make use of it

### Interface inheritance

Java provides language support for defining relationships among objects, known as inheritance

#### subtyping

- The first inheritance mechanism that we consider is known as **subtyping**
- **Subtyping** allows us to specify a **relationship** between otherwise **unrelated** classes
- We use **interface** that defines a set of common methods that each implementing class must contain
- An **interface** is nothing more than a **list of instance methods**

#### Interface inheritance

- Allows us to write client programs that can manipulate objects of any type that implements the interface
  > Even a type to be created in the future

#### Implementation inheritance

- Java also supports another inheritence mechanism known as **subclassing**
- We define a new class that **inherits** instance methods and instance variables from another class

### String conversion

- Every Java type inherits `toString()` from Object, so any client can invoke `toString()` for any object
- we generally include implementations of `toString()` that override the default in every class that we develop

### Wrapper types

- Java supplies built-in reference types known as wrapper types
- These classes consist primarily of static methods
- Java automatically converts from primitive types to wrapper types when warranted

### Equality

Java’s convention is that `equals()` must be an **equivalence** relation.

- **It must be**:

  - **Reflexive** : `x.equals(x)` is true.
  - **Symmetric** : `x.equals(y)` is true if and only if `y.equals(x)`
  - **Transitive** : if `x.equals(y)` and `y.equals(z)` are true, then so is `x.equals(z)`

- **It must take an Object as argument** and satisfy the following properties:

  - **Consistent** : multiple invocations of `x.equals(y)` consistently return the same value, provided neither object is modified.

  - **Not null** : `x.equals(null)` returns false.

```java
public class Date {
  // ...
  public boolean equals(Object x) {
    if (this == x) return true;
    if (x == null) return false;
    if (this.getClass() != x.getClass()) return false;
    Date that = (Date) x;
    if (this.day != that.day) return false;
    if (this.month != that.month) return false;
    if (this.year != that.year) return false;
    return true;
  }
}
```

> This implementation is a model that you can use to implement `equals() `for any type that you implement

### Memory management

- Object is said to be orphaned when there is no way to reference to an object
- Objects are also orphaned when they go out of scope

```java
Date a = new Date(12, 31, 1999);
Date b = new Date(1, 1, 2011);
b = a;
```

> `new Date(1, 1, 2011)` is now orphaned

Memory management turns out to be easier for primitive types because all of the information needed for memory allocation is known at compile time

- Memory management for primitive types:
  - is determined at compile time.
  - The compiler knows exactly how much memory each primitive type requires,
  - and memory is allocated accordingly.
  - This memory allocation is typically done on the stack.
- Memory management for objects:
  - is dynamic and is determined at runtime.
  - Objects are allocated memory on the heap,
  - and the amount of memory needed for an object can vary
- Once a reference variable is assigned to an object,
  - it cannot be changed to point to a different object
  ```java
  Object obj = new Object();
  obj = new AnotherObject(); // error: incompatible types
  ```
  > This policy enables Java to do efficient automatic garbage collection

### Immutability

- #### Immutable vs. Mutable Data Types:
  - **Immutable** data types, like the class `Date` ,
    - have values that cannot be changed once they are constructed.
  - **Mutable** data types, on the other hand,
    - allow manipulation of object values.
- #### Java's Support for Immutability:
  - Java use the `final` modifier to enforce immutability.
  - When you declare a variable as `final`,
    - you promise to assign it a value **only once**,
    - either in an **initializer** or in the **constructor**.
- #### Immutability Enforcement:
  - The `final` keyword in Java **guarantees immutability**,
    - **only** when instance variables are **primitive types**
    - **not** for **reference types**.
      > It only ensures that the reference cannot be changed,
      > not the object's state
  - A data type with primitive and final instance variables, such as Date, is immutable.

> - `String` objects are **immutable**. If mutability is needed, `StringBuilder` can be used.
> - `Arrays` are **mutable**. If immutability is desired, `Arrays.asList()` or `List` can be used.

## Q & A

#### What is a pointer ?

- In Java, there is only one way to create a reference: with the `new` keyword
- and only one way to change a reference: with an assignment statement
  > **_Safe pointers_**: Java can guarantee that each reference points to an object

#### What is the problem with implementation inheritance ?

**Subtyping** makes modular programming more difficult for two reasons:

1. First, **_The fragile base class problem_**:
   - any change in the superclass **affects** all subclasses
   - indeed, they are completely **dependent** on the superclass
2. Second, the subclass code, **having access** to instance variables,
   - can **subvert** the intention of the superclass code

#### How do I make a class immutable ?

**To ensure immutability** of a data type we need to make a local copy, known as a **_defensive copy_**.

#### What is null?

It is a literal value that refers to **no object**

#### What is static variables ?

- static variables are accessible to every method in the class
- In other languages, such variables are known as **_global variables_**
